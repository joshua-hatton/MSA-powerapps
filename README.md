# MSA Bootcamp 3 Submission

This app is a public transport booking app, that allows users to book physically distanced seats on trains to ensure safety on public transport, especially during peak travel times. The main aim is to encourage people to feel safe using public transport facilities again and to practice physical distancing at all times, in order to prevent further COVID outbreaks.

Users will select a train station, a time and any available physically distanced seat through the app. Once they have made a successful booking, they will get a receipt with a QR code (not currently implemented) to display at the station at the time they selected. This will prevent people without a booking from entering the station at peak times, in order to limit the number of people present in a small space and prevent the spread of COVID.

## Target User

The target persona for this app is anyone who utilises public transport, or who used to utilise it in a pre-COVID world and are anxious to do so currently. These people may be anxious because, without this booking system app, physical distance may not be guaranteed. However, if people are required to book a suitably distanced seat on public transport, this anxiety will be alleviated. One of the most attractive features of the app is the ability to see the percentage capacity of a particular train carriage at any time, and to see what other seats have already been booked. This allows users to make reasonable decisions about their safety, and puts their mind at ease by ensuring that physical distance in a small space will be enforced.

## Extensibility

Currently, the app has been tailored to trains on a single NSW train line and utilises a static data set. Ideally, the app will be expanded to all train lines in NSW and other states (possibly internationally), bus routes, light rail lines, ferry routes, etc. The data will also be imported directly from the relevant public transport corporation, to provide accurate and regularly updated times and availabilities. Furthermore, public transport corporations can utilise data from the app to analyse traveller usage patterns, and therefore make decisions about the most effective cleaning times.
